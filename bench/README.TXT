Game notes:
-----------

blitz:
------
* Is to slow to benchmark on Pi

crusnusa:
---------
* Needs initial calibration. Just press F2 until the requests
  stop. Initial environment supplied.

cubeqst:
--------
* Could do with some automation. Attact mode does not show gameplay.

gradius4:
---------
* Needs it's time set up. F2 to enter setup, arrow keys and "1" to do
  input. Initial environment supplied.
* Crashed Mame when testing checksums from the setup menu.

gtfore06:
---------
* Runs without initial environment, but second startup and disk fsck
  runs much faster. No initial environment supplied to be in parity
  with John's runs.

robotron:
---------
* Resets to factory setting on first start then does nothing. Initial
  environment supplied.

scud:
-----
* In default setup it will be stuck looking on the network for it's
  partner cabinette. Set it to not expect a network partner. F2 ->
  "GAME ASSIGNMENTS" -> "LINK ID":"SINGLE". Up and down with P1B1 (L
  Ctrl) and P1B2 (Alt), selet with service button (F2). Initial
  environment supplied.

sfiii:
------
* On startup it requests to install the game from CD. Press P1 fire (L
  Ctrl) to install and then wait 36min (on my machine, should be
  ~10min on real hardware). Initial environment supplied.

slrasslt:
---------
* Will write "24G BAD : EEPROM PARAMETER IS ILLIGAL" after calibrating
  and then just stop. To bypass that hold F2 while pressing F3
  once. After restart it will be OK. Initial environment supplied.
